    <div class="title">
      <p class="mainp">There once was a young man named Andy. He was tall and fit and loved adventures. One day he decided he wanted to explore somewhere new that was unheard of before, the Magical Enchanted Forrest. He immediately got into his car and set off for the mountains.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="slide2" class="slide">
    <div class="title">
     <p class="mainp">He had arrived. From the outside the mountains seemed normal. However, it was much quieter than most places he'd explored and the trees were thick and all the same. It was as though the mountains did not want anyone to know their secrets that there was something more here. ...But Andy knew something great was out there just waiting to be found. He had heard of this legendary forrest from his grandfather who had been told by his dad who was told by his dad which keeps going on for many generations. </p>
   </div>
  </div>
  <div id="slide3" class="slide">
    <div class="title">
      <p class="mainp">Andy started walking forward and with one deep breath stepped one foot into the dark forrest. He could not believe what he was seeing. There was nothing around. Andy thought for a second he must've gotten the location wrong and gone to the incorrect mountain. However, that thought was short lasting. Looking around the forrest Andy spotted out of the corner of his eye what appeared to be a multicolor fairy, flying quickly from a tree to the sky.</p>

  <div id="slide4" class="slide">
    <div class="title">
      <p class="mainp">He was finally here, he could not believe his eyes. Soon out of the shadows appeared more magical animals. There was a unicorn prancing around him, a pegasis was flying through the sky and water was being moved through the air, possibly because of a wizard. This was all too surreal for him. He never wanted to leave this place and all its incredible beauty.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="slide5" class="slide">
    <div class="title">
      <p class="mainp">Andy continued his adventure through the forrest. With each step forward he could feel more and more of the magic that surrounded him. The magical space was engulfing him. Would he ever be the same again after this experience, Andy decided he surely would not. After what felt like forever Andy found himself at the top of a waterfall that fell off a cliff and down toward a chrystal clear lake. Andy thought this would make for a great resting place to enjoy the beauty, take a break to eat and take in all that he had just experienced.
      <br>
      <br> 
      ... After a while Andy decided it was time to go home.</p>
